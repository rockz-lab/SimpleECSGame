# SimpleECSGame

Implementation of a simple Entity-Component-System design, based on [this](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/) blog article. Some changes were made to make the API for adding components to a system nicer.
The plan is to make a simple 2D game based on ECS test the capabilities of the design and learn about the ECS design/pattern.

## Dependencies
